# Student Learning Behavior Analysis and Teaching Management System

This project focuses on the analysis of student learning behaviors and the application of multimodal data to improve teaching management. It is grounded in cutting-edge educational technology theories and intelligent modeling techniques.

## üß† Overview

In response to increasingly complex educational environments, this project adopts advanced computational models for:

- **Modeling student behavior**
- **Optimizing teaching strategies**
- **Enhancing personalized learning paths**

Traditional teaching models often rely on simplified or static structures, which limits their capacity to reflect the dynamic and hierarchical nature of real-world learning processes. To overcome these limitations, this project introduces a multimodal framework that combines cognitive modeling, knowledge representation, and predictive analytics.

## üîç Key Technologies

- **Multimodal Data Fusion**: Integrating data from various sources (e.g., online platforms, intelligent terminals, classroom sensors).
- **Hierarchical Cognitive Modeling**: Capturing different levels of student cognitive activities.
- **Personalized Curriculum Optimization**: Designing adaptive learning paths using dynamic models.
- **AKEN & DPCO**: Leveraging the Adaptive Knowledge Enhancement Network and Dynamic Personalized Curriculum Optimization algorithms for learner-specific guidance.

## üß© System Highlights

- **Intelligent Decision-Making**: Supports personalized, multi-objective decisions via fusion learning and reinforcement learning methods.
- **Learner Trajectory Prediction**: Models learning pathways based on behavior data and predicts potential outcomes.
- **Precision Teaching**: Enables micro-level content recommendation, scenario-based training, and dynamic feedback loops.
